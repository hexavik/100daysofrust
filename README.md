# #100daysofrust

After executing and experimenting with multiple projects in C, C++, C#, Python, and PHP (server-side web development only), along with Linux Kernel Drivers, Datastructures, algorithms, and documentation through Markdown, I have started learning Rust Programming Language.

While the initial phase of learning, I realized, that it is not only the programming language but an ecosystem within. So, I wonder why not enhance it more through multiple sources of learning and create my own Rust-lang content related to domains like #embeddedsystems.

To keep up with #opensource contribution to projects in #rust and become proficient in #rustlang, I am starting #100daysofopensource, I shall soon make the video content available for everyone, or maybe some live sessions to learn along with me.

Following is the progress detail

Day 1: (started on 25th August 2022) Understanding tools and resources for rust language
Day 2: (26th August 2022) Understanding the difference between Rust and C++
Day 3: (27th August 2022) Setting up the tools and getting started with rust with the first program
Day 4: (28th August 2022) Understanding Keywords with examples
Day 5: (29th August 2022) Going through the Operators and Symbols
Day 6: (30th August 2022) Guessing Game Program
